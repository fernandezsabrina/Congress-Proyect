                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free society,
                        transparency
                        is government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart of how
                        citizens
                        hold their public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that government should be
                        transparent.

                        Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public business
                        and
                        spend taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency allows
                        good
                        and just governance. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens
                        about what their Government is doing.

                        We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the
                        Government's
                        effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in
                        society,
                        and public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you to
                        use
                        our site to become actively engaged in American government.

                        TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use. We solicit
                        public feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.</p>

                            <h3>Background History of Government Transparency</h3>
                            <p>In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible
                                to
                                public
                                opinion dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made
                                an
                                attack
                                on absolutist doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project. The
                                passage
                                of
                                formal legislative instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with Sweden,
                                for
                                example,
                                (which then included Finland as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press
                                legislation as
                                part of its constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This approach, and that of
                                the
                                philosophes more broadly, is strongly related to recent historiography on the
                                eighteenth-century
                                public sphere.

                                Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France
                                (1789),
                                freedom of
                                the press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and
                                freedom
                                of
                                the
                                press in constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean
                                statesmen
                                to
                                row back on these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal
                                politicians
                                and
                                writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent among the latter.

                                Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice
                                and
                                is
                                often
                                linked to the passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian countries
                                claim to
                                have
                                adopted the first freedom of information legislation, dating the origins of its modern
                                provisions to
                                the eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of openness after gaining
                                independence
                                in 1917, passing its Act on Publicity of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new
                                legislation
                                in 1999).

                                The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to
                                Information
                                Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.</p>
